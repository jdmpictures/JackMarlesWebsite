    <p> Well, if you’re reading this, it means I’ve finally got around to building this site. So, who’s Jack Marles? Let me tell you…

        I’m from Leeds, a proper Yorkshire lad. Leeds is a big(ish) city in the north of England — the better half of the UK if you ask me. Once famous for its textile mills (fun fact: the first steam-powered mill was opened here by Queen Victoria), it’s now known for football, nightlife, and of course, being home to Leeds United.

        By day, I work as a Fraud Investigator for a bank. Basically, I spend my time stopping scammers and keeping people’s money safe. But outside of that, I’ve always been a bit of a tech nerd. I’ve been into web development since the days of Piczo and Dreamweaver (if you know, you know). These days, I’m teaching myself modern web dev — HTML, CSS, JavaScript — with a sprinkle of cybersecurity and Linux (currently rocking Xubuntu).

       I’m also into photography. My uncle worked in film and had piles of old cameras lying around at my Nana’s, which fascinated me as a kid. I got my first DSLR — a Nikon D40x — at 13, and I was hooked. Like a lot of hobbies, it faded during my teenage years, but I’ve recently picked it back up again and remembered why I loved it in the first place.

Like many, the pandemic hit me hard. Struggling with anxiety, depression, and just feeling stuck, I finally got some proper help. Through that journey I was diagnosed with ADHD, which actually explained so much about how my brain works. With the right support, I’ve learned to work with my ADHD instead of against it. And the best part? It reignited my passion for tech and creativity.er.

               Why This Website?
Simple — I wanted a space to put my coding skills into practice, show off some of my photography, and share a little about me, because why not?

So, welcome to my site! Stick around, have a nosey, and I hope you enjoy what you see.
