    <p id="sub-title">Who is Jack Marles? </p>
    <p> Well if you are reading the then it means I've finally done it, the ADHD meds must be working!
        Who is Jack Marles? You may or may not be asking. Well, I am going to tell you anyway, I mean why else would 
        you come to an about page?
    </p>
    <p>
        So I'm from Leeds it's a biggish city in the UK in the great county of Yorkshire. If you're not familiar, Yorkshire 
        is in the North (the better half of the UK). The city is was well known for its mills and textile industry. Fun fact, my hometown 
        was home to the first steam powered mill which was opened by the Late Queen Victoria. 
    </p>

        Professionally, I am a Fraud Investigator for a bank. However, if you haven't already guessed I have 
        an interest in tech, more specifically web-development. I have always really had an interest in web dev, 
        from 'back in the day' when I used to spend hours on 'Piczo', for those who don't know it was a website that 
        let you create your own page, very minimal coding just you're drag and drop. I then moved to 'DreamWeaver' where 
        I would create pages for my 'Runescape' and other online gaming fan clubs.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also love photography. Again not to sound cliche again but this started, like many hobbies do at quite a young age. 
        My uncle works in the film industry and he had hoards of old cameras and negatives at ny Nanas house and this would 
        fascinate me. Again this followed through into my early teens, I got my first DSLR at the age of 13, Nikon D40x. 
    </p>

        However, during my late teens I fell into a popularity chase and no longer considered these 'cool', so the were 
        but on the back burner. It came to graduating sixth form, amazingly where I managed to pass with three a-levels after 
        failing first year and resitting the majority of my exams in the second year, even my teachers were shocked. I had 
        no idea what I wanted to do so chose to go with, Photography. Long story sort, I hated it but stuck by it. This only 
        pushed me further away from it. I then got a job working on the phones with the bank, couldn't even remember applying 
        for the job to be honest. I really enjoyed it there, progressed really quickly, landed myself a job managing up to 
        15 people within a few years, then joined fraud where I still am today. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I started the job around a year into Covid, this is when shit hit the fan, things really took a toll on my mental 
        health. I was depressed so didn't want to leave bed, but at the same time I was that anxious I was uncomfortable 
        and couldn't stay still. This is when I decided to do something more about my mental health, I had always struggled with 
        anxiety and bouts of depression but nothing to this extent. Luckily I get free private mental health care through work, it's 
        near impossible to see someone through the NHS. I managed to speak to someone and within the first 15 minutes of speaking to
        him he asked me if I ever considered the possibility of having ADHD. After a number of session I was diagnosed with ADHD, I got medicated and 
        coaching, learnt to work with my ADHD and understood myself a whole lot better.

        This is when I started to fall back in love with my hobbies again which leads me to the next point, why I made the website. 
        Firstly, I have been teaching myself to code over the last year or so, learning to code; HTML, CSS and Javascript mainly
        , also a bit of Cyber Security and Linux OS (Using Xbuntu right now lol). Secondly, I wanted to put into practice what I 
        heave learnt, code my own website from scratch. Third and finally, I wanted somewhere to display my work, both code and photography
        work, I hope you enjoy.
