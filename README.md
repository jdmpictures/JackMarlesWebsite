Overview

Creating a website that will display more portfolios for: photography, web-dev, other coding projects and also a blog. 

In doing to I aim to demonstrate the skills I have learnt over the last 6 months from the various tools have been using, including but not limited to; FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. 

I will use HTML and CSS to develop the website and also integrate some JavaScript too. 

The website will have a landing page 'www.JackMarles.co.uk' which will then lead onto three separate sub sections; 'www.Code.JackMarles.co.uk' which will be the base for my development portfolio; 'www.Photo.JackMarles.co.uk' will display my photography portfolio and finally 'www.blog.JackMarles.co.uk which again obviously will be the blog section. In doing this it will create a more simplistic user experience.
